# What is OOP (Object Oriented Programming)?

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach where code is organized using objects.

An object represents a real-world entity.
Each object contains:
-Data (attributes)
-Actions (methods)

For example, a car object can have data like color and speed, and actions like start and stop.

OOP helps in:

Writing organized code

Reusing code

Managing large applications easily

Python supports OOP using classes and objects.

# Difference Between OOP and Procedural Programming

Procedural Programming:

Focuses on functions and step-by-step execution

Data and functions are written separately

Suitable for small programs

Example languages: C

Object Oriented Programming:

Focuses on objects and real-world modeling

Data and functions are bundled together

Suitable for large and complex programs

Example languages: Python, Java

In short:
Procedural programming focuses on what to do
OOP focuses on who is doing it

# Data Types and Data Structures in Python
Data Types

Data types define the type of value a variable can store.

Common data types:

int – stores integers (example: 10)

float – stores decimal numbers (example: 3.14)

str – stores text (example: "Hello")

bool – stores True or False

NoneType – represents no value

Data Structures

Data structures are used to store and organize multiple values.

Common data structures:

List – ordered and changeable collection

Tuple – ordered and unchangeable collection

Set – unordered collection of unique values

Dictionary – stores data in key-value pairs

# What are Conditional Statements in Python?

Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.

They execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

Types of conditional statements:

if

if-else

if-elif-else

They are commonly used when a program needs to choose between options.

# What are Loops in Python?

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

They help reduce code repetition.

Types of loops in Python:

for loop – used when the number of iterations is known

while loop – used when repetition depends on a condition

Loops make programs efficient and shorter.

# What are Functions in Python and Why Are They Used?

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Functions are used to:

Avoid repeating code

Improve code readability

Make programs easier to maintain

Reuse logic in multiple places

Functions help break a large program into smaller, manageable parts.

# Difference Between a Class and an Object

Class:

A blueprint or template

Defines properties and behavior

Does not occupy memory until an object is created

Object:

An instance of a class

Represents a real entity

Occupies memory

In simple terms:
A class is the design
An object is the actual implementation of that design
